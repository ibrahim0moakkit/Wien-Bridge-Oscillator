# Wien-Bridge-Oscillator

Wien bridge oscillator consists of amplifier circuit and feedback circuit

The amplifier circuit consists of LM741 OP-AMP, 2100ohm resistor, and 1kohm resistor.

The feedback circuit consists of parallel RC and series RC components R=1kohm and C=0.1uF.

And R2 should be slightly bigger than R1

plugging the values to the above equation we get around

fo=1591.5 Hz

Gain for the feedback circuit (B) circuit is always equal to B=1/3.

Gain for the inverting amplifier (A) circuit is equal to A=1+R2/R1.
